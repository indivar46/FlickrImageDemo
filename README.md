# FlickrImageDemo
The application fetches image from Flickr and populate on a collectionview. To minimize load on the server Caching is implemented using NSCache class. Implemented MVVM Design pattern to acheive functionality , to seperate business logic from controller file to ViewModal . Few Test Cases are added for both api and validations.
